AHB is one of the important on-chip protocols used for communication between devices. 
The code shown is having ahb testbench with an okay response, only having all types of transactions.
And the code is still in the development stage, but the required transaction logic has been developed.

The basic idea of the project is to check ahb protocol with two agents for master and slave, with respect to the master side logics are built to send transactions.
On the receiver side agent will receive transactions from the interface, and comparison is done in the scoreboard is not yet developed.

Open to taking advice to change or updates required for code logics.
